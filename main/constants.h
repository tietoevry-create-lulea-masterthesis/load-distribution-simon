#define GRID_SIZE 10 // the length of one side of the grid of RUs
#define RU_NUM GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE // defines the number of RUs in the simulation, do not change this directly unless u want an asymmetrical grid
#define UE_CLOSEST_RUS 5 // defines the maximum number of nearby RUs that a UE keeps track of
